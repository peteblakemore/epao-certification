      <p>
        The most common reasons we can't find the apprentice are:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>the apprentice's details have changed, but the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) is not up to date</li>
        <li>the ULN given to you by the training provider does not match what we have in our system</li>
        <li>the apprenticeship is privately funded</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please contact the training provider or employer to confirm the apprentice's details.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the training provider needs to update the ILR, you'll be able to record that apprentice's end-point assessment in around 5 working days after the provider updates the ILR.
